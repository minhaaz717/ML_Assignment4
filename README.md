# Justification:
Silhouette score is the measure for the performance or accuracy of the clustering model ranging from -1 to 1, where 1 is dsaid to be best and -1 is worst. Here in this model, after feature scaling the Silhoutte score of the model reduced from 0.6176 to 0.5112, this means its quite reduced. Feature scaling and other methods of normalizing the data will imporove the stability of the model accuracy. Indeed this is large dataset with many feature variables, so this might require much tuning of the normalization parameters to improve the score and all the data are much spread with various ranges.
